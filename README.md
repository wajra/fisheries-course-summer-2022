## How marine species move through time and space
_Jeewantha Bandara_

In this exercise you will learn how to make simple visualizations on how marine species move through time. We will be using a measurement called 'Center of Biomass' to calculate where a species biomass is centered for a given year.
The data comes from annual bottom trawl surveys conducted by different 
In this tutorial we'll make use of several packages. Please check whether you have them installed on your computer.

### Prerequisites
1. Tidyverse - `install.packages("tidyverse")`
2. sf - `install.packages("sf")`
3. rnaturalearthdata
4. rnaturalearth - `install.packages("rnaturalearth","rnaturalearthdata")`
5. ggspatial - `install.packages("ggspatial")`

To install all the packages together: 
`install.packages("tidyverse","sf","rnaturalearth","rnaturalearthdata", "ggspatial")`

Follow the steps below.  
**Step 1** - Go through `center_of_biomass_exercise.R`  
**Step 2** - Set a species of your own choice. Create a series of maps through time  
**Step 3** - Create an animated GIF that shows how the species has shifted their distribution across the year.  

The final result should be an animated GIF that shows how the center of biomass for a certain species has moved through time and space.
