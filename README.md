## How marine species move through time and space
_Jeewantha Bandara_

In this exercise you will learn how to make simple visualizations on how marine species move through time. We will be using a measurement called 'Center of Biomass' to calculate where a species biomass is centered for a given year.
The data comes from annual bottom trawl surveys conducted by different 
[**Shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that helps you build interactive web apps. These web apps can take the form of dashboards, data repositories, and teaching tools. One can build a basic (but cool) web app showcasing their research or data using Shiny (With no extensive knowledge of HTML or CSS).

In this tutorial we'll make use of several packages. Please check whether you have them installed on your computer.

### Prerequisites
1. Shiny - `install.packages("shiny")` 
2. Tidyverse - `install.packages("tidyverse")`
3. Palmer Penguins - `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`
4. rsconnect - `install.packages("rsconnect")`

`install.packages("tidyverse","")`

We will walk through the following apps

### App 1
Boilerplate Shiny App (comes with Shiny) that builds a simple web app using [Old Faithful Geyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful) in Yellowstone National Park(`faithful`) data. We'll use this to understand the structure of a Shiny App.

### App 2
Build a simple Shiny App that prints out exactly what you type in. Also introduces you to putting HTML elements in a Shiny app.

### App 3

A shiny app that can be used for basic exploratory data analysis. Uses the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) (`palmerpenguins`)[](https://github.com/wajra/mid_atlantic_process_models.git)

**Happy coding with Shiny!!**
